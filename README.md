# API project for Udacity

Plan of action:
1- Create file structure for project
2- Install and instantiate Webpack and all dependencies
5- Sign up for API
6- Create HTML structure to call for url
7- Run user input through basic validator (also use html5 from pattern)
8- Make call to local server with user input
9- Have server make API call
10- return API response to browser
11- Update text and background color with api information
12- Run testing on js, and have service-workers smooth out network disruptions.

This project was, admittedly, the most frustrating so far. For the most part, this was because some curve-balls. I had to change things around just to satisfy JEST rubric. And the original API was unsupported, therefore it was impossible for me to know to what degree an error was my fault.

After receiving the new API service, things worked much better.
